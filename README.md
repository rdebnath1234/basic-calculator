# 🧮 Basic Calculator – Full Stack Version

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **full-stack Basic Calculator application** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)** and **Node.js with Express (Backend)**.

Unlike a simple frontend-only calculator, this project uses a **backend API** to handle:
- Arithmetic calculations
- Memory operations (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- Advanced operations like Square Root (√) and Percentage (%)

This project is developed as part of the **Unified Mentor Assignment** to demonstrate frontend–backend integration, error handling, and professional project structure.
The frontend UI now includes a **dribbble-inspired pink theme** with a centered **"Basic Calculator"** title, rounded display, and circular button styling.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔹 Basic Operations
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

### 🔹 Advanced Operations
- Square Root (√)
- Percentage (%)

### 🔹 Memory Functions (Backend Controlled)
- **M+** → Add value to memory  
- **M-** → Subtract value from memory  
- **MR** → Recall memory value  
- **MC** → Clear memory  

> Memory is stored **on the server during runtime** and resets when the server restarts.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-github-repo-link>
cd Basic-Calculator
```

### 2️⃣ Start Backend Server
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
Server runs on:

http://localhost:5001

### 3️⃣ Open the App

Open the calculator in your browser at:

http://localhost:5001

The Express server now serves both the frontend files and the calculator API, so you do not need to open `client/index.html` directly.
